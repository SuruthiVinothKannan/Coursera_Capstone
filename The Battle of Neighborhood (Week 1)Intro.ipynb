Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario. Toronto is an international center of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world."

You love your neighborhood, mainly because of all the great amenities and other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, graduate schools and so on. Now say you receive a job offer from a great company on the other side of the city with great career prospects. However, given the far distance from your current place you unfortunately must move if you decide to accept the offer.\n\nWouldn't it be great if you are able to determine neighborhoods on the other side of the city that are the same as your current neighborhood, and if not perhaps similar neighborhoods that are at least closer to your new job?"

That information can be used to find out neighborhoods that are same as your current neighborhood or at least similar.\n\nThe information provided by this project would be useful for people who are interested in relocating to a different part of the city and are interested in finding new neighborhoods that are highly similar to their existing neighborhood."
